# RiseUp
RiseUp is a minimalist daily task tracker built to help users build momentum and stay consistent with their goals. With a focus on simplicity and personal growth, it lets users create, manage, and complete tasks while earning experience points (XP) as rewards. Whether it's for building habits, tracking progress, or managing simple to-dos, RiseUp turns daily routines into a motivating, game-like experience.

The app is still in development, and I'm working consistently to add more features and improvements.
